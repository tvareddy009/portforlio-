    "message": "If I could describe Ganesh in one word it would be tenacious. His dogged pursuit of excellence in whatever he sets out to do, and his persistence with which he keeps on at it, was highly inspiring during our time together in college. Another one of his endearing qualities is managing a team in adverse conditions, a case in point being one of the group projects in which he was instrumental in assessing the skill of each member and assigning the responsibilities accordingly, which ensured successfully completion of project within the deadline and without compromising on the quality. I firmly believe that Ganesh would truly be an asset for any position requiring technical and soft skills and comes with my heartfelt recommendation.",
